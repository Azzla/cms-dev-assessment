Assessments

**Part 1 - Static**
Build a static HTML and CSS implementation of the comped component.

For text content, use Lorem Ipsum.

For image content, use [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)

**Part 2 - REST-API**
Build the component again, but instead of static, build this out using listings data returned from [our test API](https://sv-reqres.now.sh).

Some listings will have broken images, please use the provided fallback image as needed to ensure an image is always rendered.

**Part 3 - Filtering**
Build the component a final time with data from the API. Include listings, events, and offers data as well as a buttons that will enable a user to see all data, only listings data, only events data, or only offers data.

Some listings/evensts/offers will have broken images, please use the provided fallback image as needed to ensure an image is always rendered.
